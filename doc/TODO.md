The product of our project is NOT a static twine game. The product of our project an AI tool that parents can use to commission personalized interactive twine games for their children. 


We generate interactive twine games that are 100% static so that the parent that commisioned the personalized game can review / approve it BEFORE it they give them to their young child. This is important because what LLMs generate is not predictable.  This also allows childâ€™s iPad etc to be loaded with their personalized twines and they can enjoy them without need for internet access.
