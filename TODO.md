UPDATE concept slide to make it clear that the product of our project is NOT a single static twine game. The product of our project an AI tool that parents / children can use to make personalized interactive twine games.

We generate interactive twine games that are static so that the parent can review / approve. This is important because what LLMs generate is not predictable. This also allows childâ€™s iPad etc to be loaded with their personalized twines and they can enjoy them without need for internet access.
