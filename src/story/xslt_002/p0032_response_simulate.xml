            <setting>Interior, inside the spacious and futuristic cockpit of the alien's spaceship, embedded within the heart of the tropical island. Daylight filters in from the windows, illuminating gleaming control panels and unknown tech.</setting>

                Alien: "In our world, we don't use spoons. We use telekinesis to eat! Want to give it a try?"
                Penguin: "Teleki-what now? That sounds fun! But how does it work?"
                Alien: "Just focus on the object and imagine moving it. Give it a try with that slice of pizza!"
