In a screenplay, information about characters is recorded to help convey their identities, personalities, and actions to the actors, directors, and other members of the production team. Here's what is typically recorded about characters in a screenplay:

1. **Name and Description:** Each character is introduced with a name and a brief description that gives a general sense of their appearance and personality. This description might include physical traits, age, clothing, and any other relevant details that help the reader visualize the character.

2. **Introduction:** When a character is first introduced in the screenplay, their initial actions and reactions are often described. This provides an immediate sense of their behavior and attitude.

3. **Dialogue:** The character's lines of dialogue are written out in the screenplay, along with any accompanying stage directions or descriptions of how the lines are delivered (e.g., angrily, sarcastically, softly).

4. **Actions and Movement:** The character's physical actions and movements are described in the screenplay. This includes how they move within the scene, gestures, facial expressions, and any significant body language.

5. **Internal Thoughts and Emotions:** While internal thoughts are not typically directly written in a screenplay, the emotions a character is experiencing can be conveyed through their actions, dialogue, and expressions. Sometimes, brief voiceover or thought bubble cues might be used to indicate a character's thoughts.

6. **Backstory and Motivations:** While not always explicitly stated, a character's backstory and motivations can influence their actions and decisions. These aspects can be revealed through dialogue, interactions, or sometimes through a brief summary provided in the screenplay.

7. **Character Arc:** If applicable, a character's arc – how they change or develop over the course of the story – can be outlined in the screenplay. This helps actors understand the progression of their character's emotional journey.

8. **Relationships:** The interactions between characters are important for understanding their dynamics and relationships. These interactions are often conveyed through dialogue, actions, and reactions.

9. **Character Traits:** Specific character traits, quirks, or habits that are relevant to the story might be highlighted in the screenplay to provide depth and uniqueness to the characters.
