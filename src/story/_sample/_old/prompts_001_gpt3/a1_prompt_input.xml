A child gives you these emojis to write a children story out of them:
🦋 🐶 🚀 🌟 🌍
Inspired by these emojis you will write the child a story. Add <story_outline> elements to each <sequence> in the given XML story structure to match the <sequence> node's <description>.  For the last sequence node please add three <option> nodes that very briefly describe different ways the story protagonist's can react to the inciting incident.  Make sure each option makes sense given your <story_outline> and do not duplicate the <option> text inside the <story_outline>. Inside each <option> do not indicate it is an option. Make sure <story_outline> does not indicate which option the story will follow.  Please do not use emoji in the writing.
