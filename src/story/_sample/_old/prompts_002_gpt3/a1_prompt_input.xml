A child gives you these emojis to write a children story out of them:
ü¶ã üê∂ üöÄ üåü üåç

Inspired by these emojis you will write the child a story by editing the XML below. 

Show, Don't Tell: When possible reveal information using dialoge do not state it directly.  If a specific aspect is important for the viewer to know, reveal it using dialoge between characters. For example, if a character is sad, do not say "The character was sad."  Instead, have another character ask "Why are you sad?"  This will allow the viewer to infer the character is sad without being told directly.

Economy of Words: Be concise. You don't need long, poetic descriptions. Every word should serve the purpose of conveying essential visual or auditory information, setting the mood, or advancing the story.

Clarity is Key: While you don't want to be overly verbose, you do want to be clear. Children reading should have a good understanding action and how it relates to the entire story.

Please reply only with the updated XML.
