      <outline>Buddy, panting: "Why do you always look up there, Bella?"
               Bella, dreamily: "There's so much more beyond this meadow, Buddy. I wish I could see the stars up close."

      <setting>Exterior, the meadow's edge near a thicket of trees, late afternoon. The sun casts long shadows, and there's a soft glow from a peculiar object half-buried in the ground.</setting>
      <illustration>The meadow's vibrant colors give way to a more subdued palette as Bella and Buddy venture toward the thicket of trees. The late afternoon sun casts long, golden shadows across the grass. Amid the shadows, a small toy rocket rests, partially buried in the earth. Its intricate design catches the sunlight, creating glimmers of anticipation.</illustration>
      <outline>As Bella and Buddy play, they stumble upon a small toy rocket. It's intricate and seems to have a tiny cockpit.
               Bella, excitedly: "Look, Buddy! It's like the ones humans play with! What if... I could fly it to the stars?"
               Buddy, skeptical: "It's just a toy, Bella."</outline>

      <illustration>Bella's delicate form stands atop the rocket, her wings outstretched for balance. Her multi-hued wings catch the last rays of sunlight, creating a breathtaking display of color against the backdrop of the meadow. Buddy watches with wide eyes, his ears perked forward, his tail still. The rocket's buttons emit a soft glow, illuminating Bella's determined expression as she investigates.</illustration>
      <outline>Bella feels the rocket's buttons, and suddenly, it lights up and hums.
               Buddy, alarmed: "What did you do?!"
               Bella, joyfully: "I donâ€™t know, but maybe this is my chance to touch the stars!"</outline>
      <protagonist_reaction>Bella tries to figure out how to enter the rocket, excitedly buzzing around it.</protagonist_reaction>
      <protagonist_reaction>Bella hesitates, thinking it might be safer to just admire it from the outside and not meddle with it further.</protagonist_reaction>
