    <setting>Exterior, the beach island. Late afternoon, with the sun starting its descent. The island is peaceful, with the only noise being the soft sound of waves crashing. A wooden sign stands near Penguin’s setup, reading: "Penguin’s Pizzas – Try the Fish Only!" Birds can be seen in the distance, and there's an unusual, hovering spaceship nearby with a blinking light.</setting>
    <dialogue>
        Alien: "Why the sad face, Penguin? Isn't this island paradise?"
        Penguin: "It is, but no one wants my special fish-only pizza. Maybe I'm in the wrong business."
        Alien: "In my galaxy, we value uniqueness. Maybe you just haven't met the right customers yet!"
    </dialogue>
    <introduction>As the sun begins its descent, Penguin, deep in thought, considers his place on this beautiful island. But the wise Alien offers a different perspective.</introduction>
    <illustration>An oddly shaped, translucent spaceship hovers just above the beach sand. It emanates a soft, neon glow. The spaceship has several circular windows, revealing strange instruments and blinking lights inside. Nearby, a curious crab looks up at the spaceship, its claws raised in astonishment.</illustration>
    <illustration_title>"Beachside UFO Surprise!"</illustration_title>
    <music>Calm, soothing, and slightly whimsical beach sounds: soft strums of a ukulele, gentle waves, occasional chirping of birds, with a subtle, mystical undertone hinting at the alien’s presence – perhaps a theremin playing softly.</music>
