[[WELCOME|3648]]

:: 3648

Bella the butterfly flits from flower to flower, greeting her fellow butterflies. A playful dog, Buddy, chases his tail nearby, causing a small ruckus.

Buddy, panting: "Why do you always look up there, Bella?" Bella, dreamily: "There's so much more beyond this meadow, Buddy. I wish I could see the stars up close." Buddy, confused: "Stars? Those tiny dots? Why?"

As Bella and Buddy play, they stumble upon a small toy rocket. It's intricate and seems to have a tiny cockpit. Bella, excitedly: "Look, Buddy! It's like the ones humans play with! What if... I could fly it to the stars?" Buddy, skeptical: "It's just a toy, Bella."

Bella feels the rocket's buttons, and suddenly, it lights up and hums. Buddy, alarmed: "What did you do?!" Bella, joyfully: "I don’t know, but maybe this is my chance to touch the stars!"

    
[[Bella tries to figure out how to enter the rocket, excitedly buzzing around it.|9985]]

    
[[Bella hesitates, thinking it might be safer to just admire it from the outside and not meddle with it further.|12785]]

    
[[Bella decides to fetch some friends for advice, not wanting to embark on this adventure alone.|11307]]

:: 9985

Buddy, worried: "Are you sure about this, Bella? It could be dangerous!" Bella, hesitating: "I'm not sure, Buddy. But I've always dreamed of the stars."

Bella, nervous: "I hope I remember which button to press!" The rocket suddenly lurches, causing Bella to accidentally hit multiple buttons. Bella, panicking: "Oh no! That wasn’t right!"

Buddy, from the ground via a tiny communicator: "Bella, watch out for the storm ahead!" Bella, determined: "I see it, Buddy. I'll try to navigate around it."

[[next page.|9207]]

:: 9207

Bella, in awe: "The stars are even more beautiful up close!" The rocket's alarms suddenly blare. Bella, alert: "Oh no, asteroids!"

[[next page.|9640]]

:: 9640

Buddy, frantic: "Bella, get out of there!" Bella, with determination: "I've come this far, Buddy. I can't give up now!"

    
[[Bella attempts to steer the rocket manually, using her wings to guide the ship's levers and narrowly avoiding the asteroids.|14095]]

    
[[Bella searches for a button to activate the rocket's autopilot, hoping it can navigate the field better than she can.|13201]]

    
[[Bella shuts off the rocket's engines momentarily, floating in space, waiting for a clear path through the asteroids.|13228]]

:: 14095

The rocket descends gracefully, landing smoothly in the meadow. Buddy, relieved: "Bella! You're back!" Bella, laughing: "That was... quite the ride!"

[[next page.|14148]]

:: 14148

Bella, recounting: "The stars were amazing, but it's true what they say: there's no place like home!" Fellow butterfly: "Would you go again?" Bella, thoughtfully: "Maybe, but for now, I'm just glad to be back with all of you."

[[next page.|15376]]

Buddy, jokingly: "Still dreaming of the stars?" Bella, smiling: "Always. But I've learned that sometimes, dreams are best as just that... dreams."

[[next page.|14281]]

:: 14281

Buddy: "So, what will you do with the rocket now?" Bella: "I think I'll leave it here, as a reminder that adventures await, but there's nothing like the comfort of friends and home."

Buddy chases his tail, while Bella flits from flower to flower, a little more contentedly. Buddy, teasingly: "Ready for another space adventure?" Bella, laughing: "Maybe another day, Buddy. For now, this meadow is all the adventure I need."

As the day winds down, Bella and Buddy sit atop the rock, looking up at the sky. Bella, contentedly: "It's good to be home." Buddy, nodding: "Yes, the best adventures are the ones we share with friends."
The End!
