Lily: &quot;Good morning, Mom!&quot;
Mom: &quot;Good morning, Lily! Did you sleep well?&quot;
Lily: &quot;Yes, I had a dream about building a snowman!&quot;
Mom: &quot;That sounds like fun. Maybe we can do that after school.&quot;
Lily: &quot;Yay! Can I have ice cream too?&quot;
Mom: &quot;We'll see, Lily. Now, hurry up and get ready for school.&quot;
Lily: &quot;Okay, Mom. I'll be quick!&quot;
